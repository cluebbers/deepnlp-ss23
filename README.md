The goal for Part 1 is to implement a base BERT version including the AdamW optimizer and train it for sentiment analysis on Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). 
The goal for Part 2 is to implement multitask training for sentiment analysis on Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), paraphrase detection on Quora Question Pairs Dataset (QQP) and semantic textual similarity on SemEval STS Benchmark (STS).

## Methodology

### Part 1
We followed the instructions in the project description.

### Part 2
To create a baseline, we used the provided template and implemented a very basic model for all tasks. 
All tasks are trained on seperately. 
We achieved a training accuracy of nearly 100 %.
But dev_accuracy stopped improving early. 
So generalization is a problem.

Better generalization is typically achieved by regularization. 
First easy things to try are dropout and weight_decay. 
All tasks in the baseline share a common dropout layer. 
Since paraphrase detection and textual similarity are both about similarity, we tried to let them share an additional dropout layer for the second embeddings. 

Another approach for regularization is additional data. 
The provided datasets are imbalanced in the sense that paraphrase is by far the largest one and has the best dev accuracy in the baseline. 
Similarity and paraphrase are similar tasks, so we tried to compute cosine similarity and used this layer also in computing paraphrase detection. 
This way the similarity layer gets updated when training for paraphrase detection.

The training order in baseline is sts -> sst -> qqp. 
Since paraphrase has the largest dataset and performs best, we changed the training order to train on paraphrase first qqp -> sts -> qqp.

SMART is an approach for regularization and uses adverserial learning. 
It adds noise to the original embeddings, calculates logits and an adverserial loss to the unperturbed logits. 
This adverserial loss is added to the original training loss. 
The parameters of the added noise, and therefore adverserial loss, are optimized during training.

Sophia is a new optimizer challenging the domination of Adam. 
We tried it and compare it to AdamW.

Another possibilty is to combine losses instead of training seperately. 
This can be as simple as adding them together. 
Since gradients for different tasks can lead in different directions, Gradient slicing

We used Optuna for hyperparameter tuning. We recorded regular trainings in Tensorboard. 
```
tensorboard --logdir ./minbert-default-final-project/runs
```
## Experiments

### Part 1

```
python classifier.py --use_gpu --batch_size 10 --lr 1e-5 --epochs 10 --option finetune
```
Tensorboard: Jul19_21-50-55_Part1

### Part 2 Baseline

We created a baseline for evaluation with
```
python multitask_classifier.py --use_gpu --batch_size 20 --lr 1e-5 --epochs 30 --option finetune
```
Tensorboard: Jul23_21-38-22_Part2_baseline

After 5 epochs no significant improvements in dev metrics. Train accuracy is nearly 100 % for every task.
The conclusion is overfitting.
We did another run and recorded the dev loss.

```
python -u multitask_classifier.py --use_gpu --option finetune --lr 1e-5 --batch_size 64 --comment "baseline" --epochs 30
```
Tensorboard: Aug25_10-01-58_ggpu136baseline

The dev metrics are a bit different this time. 
I DO NOT KNOW WHY. PLEASE CHECK.
The dev loss is going up after 5 epochs. This confirms overfitting.

### Sophia Optimizer

#### Implementation

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14342) and [code](https://github.com/Liuhong99/Sophia)

The code for Sophia can be found in `optimizer.py`
We did one run with standard Sophia parameters and the same learning rate as AdamW

```
python -u multitask_classifier.py --use_gpu --option finetune --lr 1e-5 --optimizer "sophiag" --epochs 20 --comment "sophia" --batch_size 64
```
Tensorboard: Aug25_10-50-25_ggpu115sophia

The training performs very different for the different tasks.
- STS: the metrics and curves are similar to the baselines
- SST: training loss is similar to baseline. Other training metrics are worse.
- QQP: training metrics are similar to our first baseline. Dev metrics are more similar to the second baseline.

Two conclusions:
1. all tasks behave different and should therefor be trained with different parameters
2. AdamW and Sophia need different parameters

#### Comparison to AdamW

To compare both optimizers, we did an optuna study.
Training of three epochs in 100 trials with pruning. 
Comparison of Adam (learning rate, weight decay) and Sophia (learning rate, weight decay, rho, k) and their parameters.
```
python optuna_optimizer.py --use_gpu
```
Optuna: `./optuna/optimizer-*`
The slice plot shows that learning rate and weight decay should be larger for Sophia.

#### Tuning of Sophia

To find better Sophia parameters, we did an Optuna study.
Training of three epochs in 100 trials with pruning. 
A seperate optimizer for every task and tuning of learning rate, rho and weight decay.
```
python -u optuna_sophia.py --use_gpu --batch_size 64 --objective all
python -u optuna_sophia.py --use_gpu --batch_size 64 --objective para
python -u optuna_sophia.py --use_gpu --batch_size 64 --objective sst
python -u optuna_sophia.py --use_gpu --batch_size 64 --objective sts
``` 
Optuna: `./optuna/Sophia-*`

### SMART

#### Implementation

[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.197/) and [code](https://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn)

The perturbation code is in `smart_perturbation.py` with additional utilities in `smart_utils.py`
```
python -u multitask_classifier.py --use_gpu --option finetune --lr 1e-5 --optimizer "adamw" --epochs 20 --comment "smart" --batch_size 32 --smart
```
Tensorboard: Aug25_11-01-31_ggpu136smart

The traing metrics are similar to the baselines. The dev metrics are a bit better than the second baseline. 

#### Tuning 

Parameter (epsilon, step_size, noise_var, norm_p) tuning for SMART with optuna
Training of three epochs in 100 trials with pruning. 

```
python -u optuna_smart.py --use_gpu --batch_size 50 --objective all
python -u optuna_smart.py --use_gpu --batch_size 50 --objective para
python -u optuna_smart.py --use_gpu --batch_size 50 --objective sst
python -u optuna_smart.py --use_gpu --batch_size 50 --objective sts
```
Optuna: `./optuna/smart-*`
### Regularization

```
python -u optuna_regularization.py --use_gpu --batch_size 80
```
`./optuna/regularization-*`

TODO regularization with seperate dropout and weight_decays for each task

### Shared similarity layer
One layer of cosine similarity is used for both paraphrase detection and sentence similarity.

```
python -u multitask_classifier.py --use_gpu --option finetune --lr 1e-5 --shared --optimizer "adamw" --epochs 20 --comment "shared" --batch_size 64
```
Tensorboard: Aug25_09-53-27_ggpu137shared

### Combined Loss

Loss for every task is calculated. All losses are summed up and optimized.
```
python multitask_combined_loss.py --use_gpu
```
Tensorboard Aug23_17-45-56_combined_loss

The tasks seem to be too different to work well in this setup. The loss is going down as it should, but the predicted values are not good, seen in the dev_loss and dev_acc

### Gradient Surgery
Implementation from [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06782.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/WeiChengTseng/Pytorch-PCGrad)

```
python -u multitask_combined_loss.py --use_gpu --batch_size 10 --pcgrad --epochs 15 --comment "pcgrad" --lr 1e-5 --optim "adamw" --batch_size 40
```
IT STOPS WHILE OPTIMIZING BECAUSE SOME LOGITS ARE NA
